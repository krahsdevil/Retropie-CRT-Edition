| For Raspberry 2B/3B/3A+/3B+ | Released November 9, 2020 [[Changelog](https://github.com/krahsdevil/Retropie-CRT-Edition/wiki/Changelog)]| 

Adding support to Retropie for custom 15khz resolutions and some cool utilities like external extorage for ROMS, TATE mode, an overclocking tool, OLED Display handling and background music for EmulationStation among others.

This software works with some VGA666 based adapters, check compatibility [HERE](https://github.com/krahsdevil/Retropie-CRT-Edition/wiki/Adaptadores-RGB)

Maybe some professional monitors like SONY PVM, BVM or DTV could face some resolution problems, most of TV or monitors seems to work great with super-resolutions.

Special [thanks](https://github.com/krahsdevil/Retropie-CRT-Edition/wiki/Thanks-to) to all who have participated on this proyect.

**_'On the fly' resolutions system change_** based on the work of **Sir-Ironic** ['RPi-Hdmi_Timings' GITHUB](https://github.com/Sir-Ironic/RPi-Hdmi_Timings)
